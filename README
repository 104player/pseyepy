A simple interface for acquisition and saving of video from the PS3Eye camera.

This package is based on open-source libraries compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux:
    * libusb
    * [a modified version of the] PS3EYEDriver project (https://github.com/inspirit/PS3EYEDriver)
    * ffmpeg

TODO:
    * crucial: run threads for Camera.read to allow for different framerates across cameras
    * benchmark timestamps again (try to replicate the scenario where they were lagging; though seems not to happen anymore)
    * generalize paths for installation (libusb, c compilers), ffmpeg
    * explore auto-exposure settings, which is acting funky
    * protect unacceptable attribute setting in Camera class, also allow slice (:) setting
    * build a multithreaded cython option for camera streaming to free the main process
    * documentation
    * benchmarks, performance tests
