A simple interface for acquisition and saving of video from the PS3Eye camera.

This package is based on open-source libraries compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux:
    * libusb
    * [a modified version of the] PS3EYEDriver project (https://github.com/inspirit/PS3EYEDriver)
    * ffmpeg

TODO:
    * generalize paths for installation (libusb, c compilers), ffmpeg
    * explore auto-exposure settings, which is acting funky
    * attempt to fork the core camera class into a separate process (is proving harder than expected)
    * incorporate timestamps
    * documentation
